* Installation

** Requirements

   - Python >=.2.5
   - python-sqlite3
   - webserver w/ CGI support (lighttpd, apache)

** Deployment
   Copy q3stat directory (the one with images/ scripts/ inside) to
   your WWW document root you wish to use.
   Copy q3stat.conf to /etc, so that it's available under
   /etc/q3stat.conf and edit the contents appropriately:

   Example configuration file:
   --- starts here ---
   [general]
   templates-path=<path to skel directory in q3stats>/
   # format /<path>/

   document-root=/q3stat/
   [database]
   path=/<path to your database location>/stat.db
   --- ends here ---

   IMPORTANT: make sure that the database and directory in which it is
   stored are writable for the WWW user.

   Copy the q3stat.py script to your cgi-bin location. Make sure that
   the HTTP server can execute the file (typical stuff to check:
   handlers, file permissions etc.)
